# Park with Access

## Description

Parking with Access App was born out of a collective desire to address the challenges faced by individuals with accessibility requirements when searching for suitable parking spots. Our motivation stems from a genuine commitment to enhancing the mobility and convenience of every user, ensuring that everyone can access parking facilities tailored to their needs.

We built this project not just as a technical exercise but as a response to a real-world issue. Traditional navigation apps often lack comprehensive information about parking facilities, especially those catering to individuals with specific accessibility needs. The Parking Finder App aims to bridge this gap, providing a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of finding, filtering, and understanding parking options.

Key Objectives:
- Enhanced Search Capability: The app facilitates users in searching for parking spots near their desired locations, empowering them to plan their trips more efficiently.

- Tailored Filters for Accessibility: Recognizing the diverse needs of individuals, the app offers filters allowing users to customize search results based on radius, fees, and the availability of disabled parking spaces.

- User-Centric Experience: By providing a history of previous searches, the app ensures that users can effortlessly revisit past locations, fostering a more user-centric and personalized experience.

- Detailed Information and Feedback: Each search result is enriched with images, detailed descriptions, and user feedback, offering a comprehensive view of the parking spot's accessibility.

In the process of building this app, we learned invaluable lessons about the intersection of technology and accessibility. We gained insights into designing user interfaces that prioritize inclusivity, utilizing APIs such as Google Maps to enhance location-based services as well as Open Weather API to help with creating a 360 view of what the users destination will be like and creating a seamless user experience for individuals with diverse needs.

The Parking Finder App is not just a project; it's a commitment to making urban mobility more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
